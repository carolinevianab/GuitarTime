Plan for refactoring: Split the views in categories and implement them fully one at a time. The categories are named after symbols.

★ features: Components necessary for other views

▲ features: Practice views

◼ features: Module Presentation views

⚫︎ features: Module Creation views

꩜ features: Calendar related  views

Others: The views that doens't fit the other criteria
